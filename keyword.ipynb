      "Abstract: A micro unmanned aerial vehicle or drone (\"UAV\") 10 is remotely controlled through an HMI (309), although this remote control is supplemented by and selectively suppressed by an on-board controller (302). The controller operates to control the generation of a sonar bubble that generally encapsulates the UAV. The sonar bubble, which may be ultrasonic in nature, is produced by a multiplicity of sonar lobes generated by specific sonar emitters associated with each axis of movement for the UAV. The emitters produce individual and beamformed sonar lobes (80-102) that partially overlap to provide stereo or bioptic data in the form of individual echo responses detected by axis- specific sonar detectors (40-68). In this way, the on-board controller is able to interpret and then generate 3-D spatial imaging of the physical environment in which the UAV is currently moving or positioned. The controller is therefore able to plot relative and absolute movement of the UAV through the 3-D space by recording measurements from on-board gyroscopes (342), magnetometers (344) and accelerometers (346). Data from the sonar bubble can therefore both proactively prevent collisions with objects by imposing a corrective instruction to rotors (12-18) and other flight control system and can also assess and compensate for sensor drift.\n",

Selection by the user of a camera movement (6) defined by a set of parameters comprising: image shooting mode in a fixed or moving point (7); type of a movement in attitudes relative to the subject to be filmed (8); displacement velocity; displacement directions or axes; direction of the displacement (10); image shooting altitudes (9); 2. Generation of commands for positions (15) through which the drone will have to pass, from the said set of parameters (12) and from the instantaneous position of the subject to be filmed (13) as well as from its recent trajectory (14); 3. Activation of the image shooting by the video camera once the drone is launched on the positions sent by the onboard base station on the subject. The device according to the invention is particularly intended for the taking of aerial views.\n",

      "Abstract: A micro unmanned aerial vehicle or drone (“UAV”) 10 is remotely controlled through an HMI, although this remote control is supplemented by and selectively suppressed by an on-board controller. The controller operates to control the generation of a sonar bubble that generally encapsulates the UAV. The sonar bubble, which may be ultrasonic in nature, is produced by a multiplicity of sonar lobes generated by specific sonar emitters associated with each axis of movement for the UAV. The emitters produce individual and beamformed sonar lobes that partially overlap to provide stereo or bioptic data in the form of individual echo responses detected by axis-specific sonar detectors. In this way, the on-board controller is able to interpret and then generate 3-D spatial imaging of the physical environment in which the UAV is currently moving or positioned. The controller is therefore able to plot relative and absolute movement of the UAV through the 3-D space by recording measurements from on-board gyroscopes, magnetometers and accelerometers. Data from the sonar bubble can therefore both proactively prevent collisions with objects by imposing a corrective instruction to rotors and other flight control system and can also assess and compensate for sensor drift.\n",

      "Abstract: A drone safety mechanism that prevents autonomously controlled or human-in-the-loop drones from interfering with aircraft. A signal is generated at the center of an area to be maintained free of drone activity. The signal decays with distance from the source of the signal. A sensor onboard the drone is able to measure the signal itself, as well as the strength of the signal. When the signal strength passes above some threshold level, or the signal provides some other message, an intention is sent to the drone that forces the drone to stop and/or descend. The signal may be a preexisting signal, such as an electromagnetic signal emitted from a radar system atop an air traffic control tower. To prevent drones interfering with aircraft in flight, the signal may be emitted from the aircraft itself.\n",

During its passive attracting mode, the drone lands on a designated ground site and attracts insects with light, sound, and scents. Once insects are lured, the high voltage screens trap will immediately electrocute targeted insects. In its active offensive mode, the drone hovers closer to insect nests using its high- velocity propellers, producing strong downdraft jet streams to disturb the nest and force insects, such as mosquitoes and the like, to evacuate their nest. Once insects are airborne, the drone pursues fleeing insects from below or behind, making use of its propellers and vacuuming the fleeing insects. Slow flying insects that come in contact with the high- voltage electrified screens are immediately electrocuted. Insects that are vacuumed into the fast- spinning propellers blades are knocked down and killed. A rectified charging pad recharges the drone batteries.\n",

      "Abstract: A drone with a high-voltage trap seeks, identifies, pursues and destroys flying insects within a patrolling area. During its passive attracting mode, the drone lands on a designated ground site and attracts insects with light, sound, and scents. Once insects are lured, the high voltage screens trap will immediately electrocute targeted insects. In its active offensive mode, the drone hovers closer to insect nests using its high-velocity propellers, producing strong downdraft jet streams to disturb the nest and force insects, such as mosquitoes and the like, to evacuate their nest. Once insects are airborne, the drone pursues fleeing insects from below or behind, making use of its propellers and vacuuming the fleeing insects. Slow flying insects that come in contact with the high-voltage electrified screens are immediately electrocuted. Insects that are vacuumed into the fast-spinning propellers blades are knocked down and killed. A rectified charging pad recharges the drone batteries.\n",

In order to protect the drone safely flying to the destination and facilitate fishing line release in a more convenient way, the fishing line release equipment comprises a base and a release wire, said base fixing a mechanical clip release and the electrical power controlled action that release a release wire in a clamp. A controller board and a battery are fixed on the base. A cover box covers the base and electrical part are protected by the cover box. The base is fixed on the drone or UAV, one end of the release wire clamping to a gap slot in the tube that is a part of the base, the other end of the release wire connecting to the main fishing line. The clamp force can be adjusted through the nuts in the ends of tube which adjust a spring tension acting on two ball bearings which are pressed together to form a clamp in order to hold the release wire up to a pre-selected force. The release wire is clamped in the slot between the two ball bearings and the release wire is released when the pulling force coming from the fishing line excesses a threshold of a release force of the clamp.Each time a control key is pressed, an electrical motor makes a dial pad turn around, and a dial pin fixed on the dial pad pass through the gap, enforcing the two ball bearings to become separated and therefore allowing selective release of the release wire. A control signal can be supplied by a remote controller or a photoelectric switch or a signal output from the drone.\n",

This arm would typically be installed on the underside of a UAV with hover capability. The arm is designed to simultaneously vertically lower and horizontally extend a payload, permitting a person to interact with the payload without risk of injury by the UAV's propellers. This arm is practical for applications such as a routine police traffic stop, wherein an officer can safely remain in their vehicle and interact with the driver via a drone equipped with communication equipment and such an arm. The drone's arm can present the driver with a box for gathering documents from the driver without risk of injuring the driver or damaging the driver's vehicle. This is accomplished by two inventive “L”-shaped trusses that offset the arm's payload horizontally as the arm is extended downward.\n",

      "Abstract: A conventional drone with an image sensor can track an object identified by a user in its image sensor's field of view. The user draws a bounding box around the object, and as long as the drone keeps the object in the bounding box, the drone can track the object. Unfortunately, this tracking scheme isn't robust; if the object changes shape or aspect ratio or is occluded by another object, the drone will lose the object. Using a neural network to identify the object in the image stream from the image sensor increases the robustness of the tracking; a trained neural network can recognize the object from a variety of angles without any user input (no user-drawn bounding box necessary). Moreover, if the neural network is a lifelong deep neural network (L-DNN), it can learn new objects on the fly. The drone can respond by moving in a predetermined fashion with respect to the object.\n",

An aluminum tube with one open end and one closed end contains a polyethylene bottle filled with titanium tetrachloride, a smoke chemical. The bottle is held in place within the tube by means of set screws adjacent the bottle's neck. A nylon washer containing an explosive primer and a metallic disc are disposed between the bottle and the closed end of the tube. The open end of the tube is potted closed with styrofoam potting. Upon ignition, the explosive primer forces the copper disc to collapse the bottom of the bottle. The neck of the bottle shears and the titanium tetrachloride is expelled from the aluminum tube and the bottle, creating a 25 to 30 foot cloud of smoke.\n",

      "Abstract: A structure preferably over 3m high that can securely receive packages delivered by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. The structure will detect the drone when it is hovering above the module by way of audio detection means or by way of a signal sent by the UAV. Upon detecting the UAV, doors in the top of the structure will open, allowing the UAV to deposit the package within the structure. The doors will then close and the package will be lowered internally by way of a lift to the base of the structure where it can be kept securely until retrieved. The structure may have solar panels. The package receiving area may be surrounded by netting to minimise the risk an imprecise delivery.\n",

      "Abstract: The present invention relates to a drone for painting an outer wall of a multi-story building and, more specifically, to a painting drone which can float and move in the air and comprises a drone body and a floating and moving part for floating and moving the drone body in the air. A camera unit for obtaining an image of the outer surface of a building is provided on the drone body. Driving wheels for guidance to the outer surface of the building are provided on one surface of the drone body. Absorption angle members are further formed on the drone body in order to absorb the impact from the building. Paint nozzle parts for painting by spraying paint on the outer surface of the building are further formed on the drone body. By using a drone which can float and move in the air to paint an outer wall of a skyscraper, cost or painting the sky scraper can be reduced, the painting work can be simplified, fatal accidents due to falls can be prevented, and painting time can be shortened.\n",
